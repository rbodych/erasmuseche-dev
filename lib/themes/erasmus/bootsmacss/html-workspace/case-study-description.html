      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>To help mobile students settle in and integrate into the community, the university offers support from the
        moment they set foot in their new ‘home’. On arrival at the airport, newcomers are greeted by student
        volunteers, easily recognised in light blue t-shirts with the LU logo, and directed to the correct platform for
        the train to Lund. Once in the city of Lund, free minivans pick up the students from the railway station and
        take them to the Arrivals Day venue. At this ‘one-stop shop’, students register with the university, collect the
        keys to their accommodation, and receive a welcome package that includes a guide with information about LU and
        student life, a Swedish SIM-card for their mobile phone, a map, and information about public transportation.
        They can sign up for orientation activities and buy essentials for the first night - pillows and blankets - as
        well as some other basic home furnishing products. As the university does not own dorms or other accommodation,
        the housing service rents apartments from landlords and offers them for rent to local and exchange students. A
        free shuttle is  available to drop students at their accommodation. For those who have the energy after this
        full day of activites, students are invited to an ‘Arrival Meet-up’ where they can snack on chips and drinks and
        get to know other students on their first night at LU.</p>
      <p>During the first couple of weeks, incoming students participate in an orientation programme organised by the
        International Desk of LU and by student organisations. Orientation programme events and activities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General information meeting:</strong> Incoming mobile students are expected to attend an information
          meeting at which staff from the University, Student Health services, student organisations, and the Swedish
          police provide useful information about life in Lund and at LU.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Official welcome:</strong> The Vice-Chancellor of LU and the mayor of Lund host a welcome reception
          for all new international students.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Coordinators’ day:</strong> Students meet their academic coordinators to finalise study plans.
          Coordinators remain available for advice on all academic matters for the duration of the mobilty period.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Introductory swedish language course:</strong> Mobile students are offered a "Swedish in a nutshell"
          course before regular university classes start, which is designed to give an introduction to the Swedish
          language. Students can choose to sit the exam held at the end of the course, which, if successfully completed,
          results in 3 ECTS credits. Students have the opportunity to take additional Swedish language courses at LU
          (‘Swedish for Exchange Students’) during their mobility period as part of their study plan. Alternatively,
          they can continue practising their Swedish more informally at a free weekly social event, the ‘Swedish
          Lounge’, organised by the International Desk at LU.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mentor group meeting:</strong> All new exchange students are assigned to an international mentor
          group ahead of arrival, consisting of 3-4 mentors (Swedish students or international degree students) and
          15-25 new international students. Mentors contact incoming students via email a few weeks before they arrive
          to answer any questions about the university and life in Lund. After students have arrived, the mentors
          arrange activities together which facilitates their integration into the student community. For example, the
          university hosts 13 'nations', large student social clubs. Each club offers a particular atmosphere and a wide
          range of activites including lunches, brunches, sports, night clubs, formal balls and traditional festivities.
          Membership to a ‘nation’ is open to all LU students, and makes it easy for mobility students to make local
          friends. In recognition of the important contribution student mentors make, LU awards an official mentor
          certificate to those who successfully complete a semester of mentoring.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other orientation and social events:</strong> Incoming students can choose from a broad range of
          activities aimed at helping them to get to know their new environment and make new friends. To name a few,
          these include excursions to the surrounding countryside, a Swedish food-tasting event, campus walking tours,
          tours of city attractions, a sports day, pub quizzes, concerts, and game and movie evenings. On a more
          practical note, the university even offers a bus trip to a large furniture and home furnishing store in Malmö.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throughout their time at LU, international students are offered activities to help them integrate into the
        community and make them feel at home. International students who speak English, French, German, or Spanish have
        the opportunity to contribute to the local community by volunteering at a local school, helping pupils to learn
        their native language. Other activities include weekly board game evenings, special events to watch and play
        basketball offered by the Lund basketball club, industry visits (e.g. Tetra Pak and Alfa Laval), karaoke nights,
        and Christmas market visits</p>
