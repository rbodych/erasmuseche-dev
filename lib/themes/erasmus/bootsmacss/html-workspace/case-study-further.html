      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Studying abroad can be a rewarding and exciting experience, supported by host institutions that help students
        to find their feet and integrate into the wider community.nts.ays.</p>
      <p>When mobile students arrive, they face the task of navigating and settling into an unfamiliar higher education
        institution (HEI) system, making friends, and integrating into the local culture. Many institutions facilitate
        this process by offering a range of support activities, such as informational meetings, academic mentor schemes,
        and language courses. Local student networks, such as the Erasmus Student Network (ESN), often set up ‘buddy
        systems’ and organise social and cultural events.ays.</p>
      <p>Lund University (LU) offers an extensive programme to help incoming students integrate into the life of the
        institution and of the local community, make friends, and feel ‘at home’ right from the start. The University’s
        approach to student integration is holistic. LU offers a full and carefully-programmed range of events to help
        students settle in and meet new people. This centres around welcome and orientation activities in the early
        stages of the students’ mobility periods, and continues throughout term time. Opportunities to make real
        contributions to the local community are offered and promoted, helping incoming students to integrate into their
        new environment in other meaningful ways.</p>
      <p>Lund University is located in southern Sweden, and has a student enrolment of 42,000. Its eight faculties cover
        a broad spectrum of academic disciplines, from engineering and medicine to law and fine arts. LU is one of the
        most active institutions in the Erasmus programme. The university ranked number 18 in the list of “Top 100 HEIs
        receiving Erasmus students” in 2012/13. It hosts around 900 Erasmus students every year and has agreements with
        around 400 HEIs in Europe.</p>
