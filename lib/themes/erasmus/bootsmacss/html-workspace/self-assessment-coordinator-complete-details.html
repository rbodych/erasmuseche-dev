                  <h2>Must have</h2>

                  <p><strong>1.4 The institution has a clear plan to implement the strategy</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>The strategy and policy should include explicit allocation of responsibilities for its efficient
                    implementation to
                    individuals at all levels of the institution, from senior management to the heads of departments,
                    schools and
                    faculties, to academic and administrative stań. This will ensure acceptance and accountability for
                    the strategy.
                    The internationalisation strategy and policy should outline a specific implementation plan that sets
                    out explicitly
                    the financial and human resources availableE For example, it is recommended to set up an
                    International Rela-
                    tions Ofiice (IRO) to implement mobility and other intemational projects.</p>

                  <p>As with any other activity, the institutional implementation of the internationalisation strategy
                    is dependent on
                    the people behind the activities. It is highly important for an institution to have stań with the
                    right set of skills
                    and knowledge driving the internationalisation agenda and liaising with international students and
                    stań mem-
                    bers. Therefore understanding the development needs of the stań and supporting their professional
                    development
                    should be a high priority for the institution. Such development should focus on both stań engaged in
                    internatio-
                    nal activities as well as the supporting stań, ensuring the most efficient implementation of
                    international activities
                    and cooperative projects across the institution. For example, trainingsfwebinarsfprojects could be
                    organised on
                    intercultural competences and communication, project management, enhancement of internationalisation
                    at
                    home/interculturaL or other activities suggested by the stań and supported by the hierarchy.</p>

                  <h2>Best practices</h2>

                  <p><strong>1.2 It promotes incoming and outgoing student and stań mobility</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>Mobility is important to the development of the institution as a whole as well as for the
                    individual participants.
                    Therefore the HEI should make mobility and international cooperation a central element in its
                    institutional poli-
                    cies, and explicitly and consistently promote and support student and stań mobility.
                    Non-discrimination policies
                    and further emphasis on the promotion of mobility for under-represented groups should also form an
                    integral
                    part of the institutional support structures.</p>

                  <p><strong>1.3 It promotes engagement in European and international cooperation projects</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>The institution's internationalisation strategy and policy should explicitly and consistently
                    promote the develop-
                    ment of cooperation with partners in other EU and non-EU countries. The activities and co-operation
                    projects
                    agreed by the HEI should be based on identified needs. In addition they should identify geographical
                    and subject
                    priorities of the internationalisation strategy.</p>

                  <p><strong>1.5 The implementation of the strategic plan is monitored</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>Intemational activity, including co-operation projects and mobility should be carefully monitored.
                    Clear and
                    unambiguous monitoring of such activity are key to ensuring success. Explicit indicators should be
                    developed to
                    show specific success scenarios. The indicators should be SMART.</p>

                  <p><strong>1.6 Specific support measures are provided to stań working at all levels of the institution
                    with outgoing and inco-
                    ming participants. For example: allocation of additional resources, training on intercultural
                    competences and
                    other relevant aspects of the mobility</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>The institution should allocate additional resources to support stań working at all levels of the
                    institution with
                    outgoing and incoming participants, such as allowing stań adequate time to carry out work with
                    outgoing and
                    incoming participants and providing administrative back-up (e.g. with financial management).
                    Trainingsfwebinar-
                    Slprojects could be organised on intercultural competences and communication, management of mobility
                    pro-
                    jects', enhancement of internationalisation at home/intercultural, or other activities suggested by
                    the stań and
                    supported by the hierarchy. As part of the institutional modernisation and internationalisation
                    strategy, concrete
                    support measures should be defined at both institutional and departmental levels.</p>

                  <p><strong>1.7 Incentives are provided to stań involved in international activities</strong></p>

                  <h2>Gudance note:</h2>

                  <p>Participation in such intemational projects should be seen as an important aspect of the
                    professional develop-
                    ment of the stań and of the modernisation of the HEI. It should, therefore, be considered a key
                    component in
                    stań evaluation. As part of the institutional modemisation and internationalisation strategy,
                    concrete support
                    measures should be dehned at both institutional and departmental levels to encourage and recognise
                    stań parti-
                    cipating in such projects, as well as allow adequate time to carry out this work</p>
